//! shoogah is a crate with all sorts of syntactic sugar for Rust. Many of the
//! items are inspired from the goodness of other languages, especially *Groovy*.
//! Some operations require an expanded notion of what is *true* and what is *false*.
//! In these cases, we make use of the `AsBool` trait from the `as_bool` crate.
//! Any type that implements `AsBool`, will work with the macros in `shoogah`
//! that require such *truthiness*.

/// map lets you define a `std::collections::HashMap` via a simple literal.
///
/// For example:
/// ```ignore
///     let my_map = map! [
///         "a": 1,
///         "b": 2,
///         "c": 1 + 2,
///     ];
/// ```
/// In this example, `my_map` is of type `std::collections::HashMap<&str, i32>`.
/// To create an empty map:
/// ```ignore
///     let my_map = map![:];
/// ```
/// Map keys can be identifiers (variable names) or lietral expressions like `1`
/// or `"Hello"`. Map values are expressions. The returned value is a
/// `std::collections::HashMap` and thus all normal type checking rules and
/// trait requirements apply.

/// called the *ternary* operator in other languages.
///
/// For example:
/// ```ignore
///     let username = cxp!{ (3 > 4) ? ("a") : ("b") };
/// ```
/// This expands to a normal Rust if/else expression, so Rust syntax and type
/// rules apply to the expressions. Given how complex expressions can be, the
